This project contains tar'ed images of the FOSS packages used in the Rhpro-11 sterilizer firmware.

The orgination of this repository is simple:
1) top level is the README.md file (this file)
2) foss directory contain a directory for each package deployed in an installation.

Each package directory contains zero or more 'patches' to the project plus a subdirectory containing the source code.
Additional files and directories may exist if required for the particular package.

Patches are those to be applied to the upstream version.
