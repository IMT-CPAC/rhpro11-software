A few years ago I found a nifty stat wrapper somewhere on the internet. It
worked well for me and I used it quite often. But through the years I lost
the source and could not find it anymore. So I decided to write my own and
release it to the public. I modelled it closely to the original (as I still
had a binary).

Hopefully this is of use for you.

A few days ago Radovan Garabik <garabik@fmph.uniba.sk> told me he wrote a 
command line wrapper for the statfs(2) libc call based on my stat program.
After I got his sources I added this feature to stat. I only changed the
output formatting.

If you have a filesystem for which stat reports a type of UNKNOWN, please
send me the magic number that is listed after UNKNOWN.

I've set up stat for larger filesystems. Depending on your system you might
have to define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 resp. undefine _LARGEFILE_SOURCE.
